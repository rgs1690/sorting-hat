## About the User 
-The ideal user is any Harry Potter fans that would like to have fun sorting them and their friends into different houses. 

## Features 
- A form appears after clicking the "Let's Begin" button and allows users to enter a name that will be randomly sorted into a Hogwart's house.
- After submitting, a card will generate and will be colored accoriging to their house assignment's color. 
- The cards will also be ordered alphabetically by name. 
- Filter buttons are located above the card section and allow the user to see only the cards in a particular house.
- A student can be expelled. This pushes the card into the "Voldemort's Army" section. The card will change styling to show a death eater image.
- This site is also responsive to smaller screens.
